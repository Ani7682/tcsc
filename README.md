# tcsc
In this project, a TCSC (Thyristor-Controlled Series Capacitor) is implemented on MATLAB, along with its output waveform, and RMS Thyristor-Controlled Series Compensation (TCSC) is used in power systems to dynamically control the reactance of a transmission line in order to provide sufficient load compensation.  The benefits of TCSC are seen in its ability to control the amount of compensation of a transmission line and in its ability to operate in different modes. These traits are very desirable  since loads are constantly changing and cannot always be predicted values.

A thyristor-controlled series compensator is composed of a series capacitance which has a parallel branch including a thyristor-controlled reactor.
